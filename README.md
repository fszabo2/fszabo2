- 👋 Hi, I’m Fero
- 👀 I’m interested in: good books, mainly sci-fi or fantasy novels. Productivity and selfhelp books from time to time... Satisfying my gear aqcuisition syndrome (some call this hobby photography). Stocks and investment. Diy stuff. Making life easier, cause it's hard enough as it is. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do my job, i.e. developing a Spring applicaiton running on Apache Tomcat. :)  Also, 2D game development with unity.
- 💞️ I’m looking find more free time... As I don't have enough.
