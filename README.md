- 👋 Hi, I’m Fero
- 👀 I’m interested in: good books, mainly sci-fi novels. Productivity from time to time, to have more downtime... Satisfying my gear aqcuisition syndrome (some call this hobby photography)... 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do my job, as always. :)  Also, 2D game development with unity. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting thru life. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I am not ready to be reached, yet. Come back in a year or two, or try to find me afk. ;) fero at apache dot org might work as well.
